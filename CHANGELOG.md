# [v4.0](https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/KeyboardSwitch/releases/tag/v4.0) (28 November 2021)

- The app now works on Linux (via X11 only; Wayland is not supported)
- The legacy hot-key mode was removed - only the modifier keys mode is available
- The UI theme is overhauled
- The converter is hidden by default
- .NET 6 is used instead of .NET Core 3.1
- The app's performance was improved, though it's still not ideal

This is the first major version of the app which is not completely rewritten, though it was significantly changed. From
now on, most changes (like macOS support) will come as minor versions, and version 4 will be the major version for the
foreseeable future.
