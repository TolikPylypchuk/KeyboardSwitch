# Other Tabs

{% hint style="warning" %}
Version 4.0 is not yet completed. You'll have to get a [nightly build](https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/KeyboardSwitch/actions/workflows/main.yml) if you want to install the app. It works on Windows and Linux; macOS support will come in a future release. The app itself and these docs may change at any moment without warning until version 4.0 is released.
{% endhint %}

Other tabs in the settings app include the Sandbox tab and the About tab.

## Sandbox

Sandbox is absurdly simple - it's just a text box. That's it! Here's how it looks:

Sandbox lets you play around with switching text when you change the app's settings. It contains no logic whatsoever. It's literally just a text box.

## About

The About tab contains some general info about the app. Here's how it looks:

If you want more info, you can view the docs (these very pages).

You can also check whether updates for the app are available. If they are indeed available, then you can go to the releases page on GitHub to get them. Currently the app doesn't support auto-updating, so you will have to install a newer version yourself (if you installed the current version). Remember that you have to stop the service app before installing a newer version.

That's it for the settings app. If you want technical info about Keyboard Switch, you can check out the next articles.
