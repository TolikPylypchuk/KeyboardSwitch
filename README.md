# Keyboard Layout Switch

Version 2.0 (in progress)

Created by Tolik Pylypchuk

This application is created to switch typed text as if it was typed with another keyboard layout.

All you have to do is select the mistyped text, cut (or copy) it to the clipboard, press the key combination of your choice (default are Ctrl+Alt+X and Ctrl+Alt+Z) and then just paste the switched text.

The app is completely customisable: you can set character mappings, add new ones, delete them, and even move them, if you want (to do that, click on a column of characers and press an arrow key).

By default scrolling in the settings window is horizontal. If you want to scroll vertically, press Ctrl while you scroll. Touchpad horizontal scrolling is not supported.

The app runs on the background, so if you close the settings window, it will not shut down. It uses a tray icon, so you can see that it's there.

The app uses the list of your input languages in the same order, as defined by the system. You can switch both forward and backward through this list. The app also automaticly changes your input language, so you don't have to do it yourself. You cannot add a language that's not present as one of the system's input languages.
If you add/remove an input language while the app is running, you'll have to restart it.

Note: it uses a single layout for a language. e.g. if you are using both English QWERTY and English DVORAK, you can only set one of them for the app to switch.

I hope this app will make your life at least 1% easier :)
