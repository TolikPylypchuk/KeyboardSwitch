				<h1>Keyboard Layout Switch</h1>

				<p>Version 2.0</p>
				<p>Created by Tolik Pylypchuk</p>

				<p>
					This application switches typed text
					as if it were typed with another keyboard layout.
				</p>

				<p>
					This project is open-source. You can find the source code
					<a href="https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/KeyboardSwitch">here</a>.

				<h2>Installation</h2>

				<p>
					This app can be either installed or used as a portable app.
					The only difference is that the installed version gets
					a shortcut in the Start Menu and will be started when
					you log into the system.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<a id="default"></a>
				<h2>Default Switching</h2>

				<p>
					To switch text, all you have to do is select the mistyped text,
					cut (or copy) it to the clipboard, press the key combination
					of your choice (the defaults are Ctrl+Alt+X to switch forward
					and Ctrl+Alt+Z to switch backward) and then just paste
					the switched text.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<a id="instant"></a>
				<h2>Instant Switching</h2>

				<p>
					In addition to the default switching mode this app also
					offers the instant mode.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Warning!</strong>
					Instant switching mode is less stable than the default mode.
					Sometimes it doesn't switch properly. Use it with caution.
				</p>

				<p>
					Instead of copying and pasting the text manually, you can
					use the instant switching mode. It will copy the text, switch it
					and paste it in one go. You just have to select the text and
					press the key combination (the defaults are Ctrl+Shift+X
					to switch forward and Ctrl+Shift+Z to switch backward).
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Note:</strong>
					A few things to consider:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The app simulates pressing Ctrl+C to copy
							and Ctrl+V to paste text. This is the default
							behaviour for most (if not all) applications.
							But if you are working in an app which behaves
							differently on those key presses, this app will
							not be able to switch text.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ctrl+Shift work best as the modifier keys for instant
							switching because pressing Alt will change the focus
							to some kind of a menu in most apps.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<a id="settings"></a>
				<h2>Settings</h2>

				<p>
					The app is completely customisable:
					you can set character mappings, add new ones, delete them,
					and even move them around.
				</p>

				<p>
					To quickly change mappings, you can use the TAB key. It will move
					the input focus to the next item in the mapping table.
					In addition, it will change the input language so you don't have
					to do it yourself.
				</p>

				<p>
					By default scrolling in the settings window is horizontal.
					If you want to scroll vertically, press Ctrl while you scroll.
					Touchpad horizontal scrolling is not supported.
				</p>

				<p>
					The app runs in the background, so if you close
					the settings window, it will not shut down.
					It uses a tray icon, so you can see that it's there.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<a id="langs"></a>
				<h2>Languages</h2>

				<p>
					The app uses the list of your input languages in the same order
					as defined by the system. You can switch both forward
					and backward through this list. The app also automaticly
					changes your input language, so you don't have to do it yourself.
					You cannot add a language that's not present as one of
					the system's input languages.
					If you add/remove an input language while the app is running,
					you'll have to restart it.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Note:</strong>
					The app uses a single layout for a language.
					e.g. if you are using both English QWERTY and English DVORAK,
					you can only set one of them for the app to switch.
				</p>

			<section>
				<a id="config"></a>
				<h2>Configuration</h2>

				<p>
					The mappings that this app creates are stored in the
					file called mappings.dat. The file itself is stored in the
					local app data folder.
				</p>

				<p>
					There is another mappings.dat file - the one stored with the
					app. This file contains the default mappings. They are used
					when the app is started for the first time for a user.
