The installer will install two applications - Keyboard Switch and Keyboard Switch Settings. The app will run in the background and start when you log in.

You shouldn't start Keyboard Switch directly - you should control it through the settings app.

If you want to uninstall Keyboard Switch, then simply removing the .app bundle from the Applications folder won't be enough. You'll have to download and run another package - KeyboardSwitchUninstaller - it will completely remove Keyboard Switch from your system. You can read more at https://docs.keyboardswitch.tolik.io.
