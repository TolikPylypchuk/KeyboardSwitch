The installer will install two applications - Keyboard Switch Service and Keyboard Switch Settings. The service app will run in the background and start when you log in.

You shouldn't start the service app directly - you should control it through the settings app.

If you want to uninstall Keyboard Switch, then simply removing the .app bundle from the Applications folder won't be enough. You'll have to download and run another package - KeyboardSwitchUninstaller - it will completely remove Keyboard Switch from your system. You can open the settings app, go to the 'About' tab, click 'View the docs', and then click 'Get the App' in the opened page. This will lead you to the uninstaller package.
